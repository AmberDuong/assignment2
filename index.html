            After learning the basic principles of Javascript programming in Module 1 and Module 2, 
            along with further researching and practicing, I have developed several skills to work on 
            the weekly exercises: designing a logo, designing an animation, and designing an interactive 
            artwork respectively, using code. Besides, I have applied some HTML and CSS knowledge I got to 
            upgrade the overall look of the website. <br> <br>
